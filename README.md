## Description

When preparing a report for stakeholders, it is important to have up-to-date information about members of the development team. Rather than navigating to each team member's GitHub profile, a command-line application will allow for quick and easy generation of profiles in PDF format.

The PDF user profile contains the following:

* Profile image
* GitHub User name
* Links to the following:
* User location via Google Maps
* User GitHub profile
* User blog
* User bio
* Number of public repositories
* Number of followers
* Number of GitHub stars
* Number of users following
